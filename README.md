### Hi, I'm Julia Borisova

#### Junior researcher in Composite AI Lab, PhD student at ITMO University

My research field is composite, hybrid modelling and AutoML for environmental simulation cases, mostly for ocean hydrodynamics.
I am specialist in GIS and cartography (create maps, infographic and so forth).

As the part of the [NSS Lab](https://itmo-nss-team.github.io) team I'm currently working on [FEDOT framework](https://github.com/nccr-itmo/FEDOT) and other tools for natural fields reconstruction.

My research papers are available in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ru&user=kOPGTPoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F6xrMERTiZDoTCrR8gByAQli9Y7z6xaHJgjm3IT0E5_pRYxFNT8gW6glfwYeYibRTBqoKF7Miaa3Hkv1Su1WLAWNSWhXk2O8YLgMkpkZ7jtwbcyK_16Ft3elXJDhL9BLHHRN8DX).
